# GraphQL

**GraphQL** is a modern replacement of the almost obsolete **REST** approach to present API. 
It's been almost 16 years since the **REST** idea was found in 2000 by Roy Fielding. 
With all credit to everything we accomplished using REST it's time to change for 
something better. **GraphQL** advanced in many ways and has fundamental 
improvements over the old good **REST**:

- Self-checks embedded on the ground level of your backend architecture.
- Reusable **API** for different client versions and devices, i.e. no more need in maintaining `/v1`, `/v2` or `/v10002545.07E20`.
- A complete new level of distinguishing of the backend and frontend logic.
- Easily generated documentation and incredibly intuitive way to explore created **API**.
- Once your architecture is complete â€“ most client-based changes does not require backend modifications.
- It could be hard to believe but give it a try and you'll be rewarded with much better architecture and so much easier to support code.

# What is Railgun? 

This is a pure async PHP realization of the **GraphQL** protocol based on the 
[youshido/graphql](https://github.com/Youshido/GraphQL) and/or 
[webonyx/graphql-php](https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php#fields)
core drivers of the official GraphQL Specification 
located on [Facebook GitHub](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/).
